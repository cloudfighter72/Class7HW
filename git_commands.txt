remove one file from stage: git rm --cached <file name>
remove multiple files from stage: git rm --cached -r .
to see your commit: git log

to see what is in the file: cat <file name>
To reset the file to the state from previous commit:
cat <file name>
git checkout <file name>
cat <file name>
git status

remove all changes in one short command:
git checkout .
git status
All changes are reverted and our directory in consistent with previous commit.

reset the HEAD to the state before committing the last file: git reset --soft HEAD~1


to check diff for one file: clear && git diff HEAD~1 <file name>
git diff: checks the differences between HEAD and current working directory, i.e.: what was changed during our recent work.
git diff --staged: shows any difference in files that are staged
git show: information similar to git log
quit git log: q

git tag: checks for any tags
git tag -a v1.0 -m "version 1.0. initial state": tag will read "version 1.0 initial state"
git show <tag name>: shows what is inside the file
good practice is to use v and number which describes the changes from previous tag

git checkout: moves between branches. add -b creates a new branch
git branch -r: lists branches from remote

switch to master and merge changes: 
git checkout master
git merge <branch name> --no-edit
clear && git adog
And this is the final state. Merge created a new commit to reflect changes caused by the process.
As we finished work on branch, we can delete it: git branch -d <branch name> && git branch



git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin 
git push -u origin <webpage>
